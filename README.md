In these projects, I developed a course planner application for ABCU's Computer Science program. The main challenge was to efficiently store, retrieve, and display course information, including prerequisites. I approached this problem by implementing and comparing different data structures: vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. This process highlighted the importance of understanding data structures. Each had unique strengths and trade-offs in terms of runtime efficiency and memory usage. Vectors offered simplicity, hash tables provided faster lookups, and binary search trees maintained sorted order efficiently. One significant roadblock was ensuring data validation when reading the course file. I overcame this by implementing a thorough validation function. It checked for proper file formatting and the existence of prerequisites. This experience taught me the importance of error handling and input validation in creating reliable software. Working on these projects has expanded my approach to software design. It emphasized the need to consider both functionality and performance. I learned to analyze runtime complexity and make informed decisions about which data structure to use based on specific requirements. This has made me more thoughtful about the broader implications of design choices in software development. Furthermore, this project has evolved my coding practices. I now prioritize maintainability, readability, and adaptability. I've improved my code organization, using clear function names and comments to explain complex logic. The modular design I implemented has made the code more adaptable to potential future changes or expansions. In conclusion, these projects have enhanced my technical skills in implementing data structures and algorithms. They have also deepened my understanding of effective software design principles and practices.
